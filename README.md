This project is dedicated to fulfilling a crucial requirement in the e-commerce sector, with a specific focus on the Amazon platform. The primary objective is to conduct an in-depth analysis of customer sentiments by leveraging a combination of web crawling and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By harnessing these methodologies, the project aims to extract meaningful insights from an extensive reservoir of customer reviews. The collected data serves as the foundation for training a machine learning (ML) model specialized in sentiment classification. The outcomes of this model hold substantial implications for various aspects of business operations, including product enhancement, refinement of marketing strategies, and the overarching perception of the brand. By systematically integrating web scraping and NLP, this initiative seeks to unravel valuable patterns within customer feedback, ultimately empowering businesses on the Amazon platform to make informed decisions that enhance customer satisfaction, optimize marketing endeavors, and cultivate a positive brand image in the highly competitive ecommerce landscape.
